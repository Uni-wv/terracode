# Webpage code  for Hybrid Multi Cloud Task 1

The Code is written in HTML5, JAVASCRIPT & CSS. I have made this as my 1st year project when i have learnt HTML and CSS first time. 
The purpose of this project was to learn and implement. Though the code is not yet complete. Ready to colaborate and modify the code. 
Note:- The photographs that I have used are all clicked by me.( Not for any commertial use)

# Why I have put the code here?
This code will run on cloud instance which I have created using terraform. I have created another repository (terrcode_snip) and put
the my terraform code there from which you may also can creted same Infrastucture as mine on AWS (Amazone Web Services) just by changing 
profile.

Thankyou.
